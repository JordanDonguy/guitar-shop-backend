The Martin DJr-10 dreadnought junior acoustic guitar delivers full, balanced tone in a smaller form. Featuring a solid Sitka spruce top with sapele back and sides, this instrument is built to Martin''''s exacting standards with premium tonewoods. The DJr-10''''s dreadnought body style produces a bold, punchy sound, while its shorter 24" scale length and 1-3/4" nut width provide comfortable playability for smaller hands. The DJr-10 is an ideal first "real" guitar for kids and a perfect travel companion for any player.

## Solid Sitka Spruce Top Provides Clear, Articulate Tone
The DJr-10''''s solid Sitka spruce top is prized for its strength, clarity and balanced tone. Sitka spruce is a straight-grained tonewood with optimal stiffness and damping that helps produce crisp articulation, tight bass and sparkling trebles. As the top ages, the tone mellows into a sweet, musical quality. The solid wood top also allows for more complex overtones and harmonic richness versus a laminate top.

## Specially Sized for Younger Players and Travel
With a 24" scale length, 1-3/4" nut width and modified body depth, the DJr-10 is made to fit smaller hands while still producing full tone. The shorter scale makes frets closer together, allowing for easier fingering. The slimmer nut width provides more comfortable spacing between strings. The modified body depth trims excess size without sacrificing acoustic properties. Altogether, the DJr-10''''s compact proportions make playing and transporting the guitar easy for anyone.

## Premium Features and Appointments
Like all Martin guitars, the DJr-10 is built using the highest-quality materials and time-honored techniques. It features a mortise and tenon neck joint, sapele back and sides, modified low oval neck shape and solid mahogany neck. The fingerboard and bridge are made from black richlite, a durable, sustainable material made from resin and wood fibers. Nickel open-gear tuners provide smooth, accurate tuning.

For slightly more than 90 years, the Martin D-28 dreadnought has been the go-to acoustic guitar for celebrated artists, such as Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Nancy Wilson, Neil Young, Brad Paisley and scores of other legends. It has also enriched the careers of hit-making songwriters, working professionals and aspiring players looking to make their mark. In its quest to help musicians find their perfect sound, Guitar Center carries the eminent Martin D-28 Standard to inspire discerning creators.


## Renowned Acoustic Tone
The Martin D-28 is sought after by so many singers, because its rich, warm and silky sound truly highlights vocal timbres—whether it''''s a Johnny Cash-style baritone or a Nancy Wilson-like shimmer. However, the D-28 also produces complex and articulate midrange frequencies, airy highs and a stout, clear low end that rewards instrumentalists—pickers, fingerpickers, rockers and strummers alike—with strong projection that can soar over a band or multiple players. The D-28''''s expressive dynamics let you rock with fury and shift immediately into soft chords or arpeggios. Savvy players can command the D-28''''s tonal and dynamic versatility to bring their compositions to life.


## Great Playability
The D-28 dreadnought is a big and broad guitar—which informs its deep, bell-like tone and muscular projection—but it''''s also easy to play. So easy, in fact, that most players who move back-and-forth between electric guitar and acoustic guitar shouldn''''t be hampered at all. The D-28''''s satin-finish, slim "High Performance Taper" neck will thrill players who like to burn from open positions all the way down to the 14th fret. However you play, the D-28 won''''t stand in your way. Shred. Slap. Fingerpick. Use it like a beat box, strum or tap. The easy playability of the D-28 can inspire new techniques and unexplored artistic journeys.


## Old-School Looks & Modern Features
The Martin D-28 broadcasts a striking vintage vibe with its aged toner top, antique-white binding and open-gear tuners. However, today''''s D-28 is very far from a nostalgia piece. The lean, modified low-oval neck is shred ready, and the forward-shifted, non-scalloped X-bracing produces punchy, balanced midrange frequencies that stand front and center in any mix.

The ''''68 Custom Princeton Reverb is Fender''''s modern take on the legendary late-60s Princeton Reverb combo amp. Loaded with a modified tone circuit and 10" Celestion TEN 30 speaker, this 30W all-tube amp delivers greater tonal versatility and a distinct rock ''''n'''' roll flavor. The reduced negative feedback also provides increased touch sensitivity and quicker overdrive.

## Modified Tone Circuit Offers Enhanced Versatility
The ''''68 Custom Princeton Reverb''''s modified tone circuit provides you greater control over your tone when using effects pedals. Roll back the tone for a warmer, bassier sound or crank it up for brighter highs. This amp handles pedals beautifully, allowing you to craft your signature sound.

## 10" Celestion Speaker Delivers Punchy Rock Tone
The ''''68 Custom Princeton Reverb is equipped with a single 10" Celestion TEN 30 speaker, specially designed to emphasize midrange frequencies important for cutting through a mix.

The JTM amp head is a welcome addition to the Studio range, offering players authentic, smooth and valve-driven break-up at lower volumes—perfect for home or studio use. Don''''t let its size fool you, because the all-valve tone of the Studio JTM packs a punch.

The Studio JTM offers the same control and versatility as older models, where simply patching the two channels together opens up a world of all-valve tonal possibility. Power switching enables you to switch effortlessly between 20W and 5W and two loudness controls mean you can play as loud as you like. Features such as a DI out and FX loop have been added, bringing the JTM into the now.

## Jumping Channels
Being a classic amplifier, the Studio JTM series is a 2-channel amplifier without traditional channel switching. Each channel has a high-sensitivity input, voiced to take a guitar with high-output pickups and a low-sensitivity input, voiced for a guitar with lower-output pickups having more gain and allowing you to take advantage of that increase in gain to go full rock ''''n'''' roll. Each channel has its own tonal color and a master volume control. The Bass Mid and Treble controls are shared between the two channels.

A lot of times you will see guitar players running a short jumper cable between the two channels of the amplifier. Doing this allows you to blend the tone of the two channels with the master volume controls taking full advantage of the amplifier''''s capabilities.

This is accomplished by a very simple process. Plug your guitar on the low-sensitivity input of channel 1 Connect input 2 of channel 1 to input 1 of channel 2 using an instrument patch cable. You can then blend the channels by adjusting the channel volumes of the amplifier. Try it out for yourself to open the tonal capabilities of this amp.

The JTM combo is a welcome addition to the Studio range, offering players authentic, smooth and valve-driven break-up at lower volumes—perfect for home or studio use. Don''''t let its size fool you, because the all-valve tone of the Studio JTM packs a punch. Like the original 30W head, the Studio JTM is loaded with two ECC83 preamp valves, two 5881 power amp valves and one ECC83 phase splitter, taking you right back to the renaissance of rock ''''n'''' roll.

Features such as a D.I. out and FX loop have also been added, bringing the JTM into the modern day.


## Jumping Channels
Being a classic amplifier, the Studio JTM series is a 2-channel amplifier without traditional channel switching. Each channel has a high-sensitivity input, voiced to take a guitar with high output pickups and a low-sensitivity input, voiced for a guitar with lower output pickups having more gain and allowing you to take advantage of that increase in gain to go full rock ''''n'''' roll. Each channel has its own tonal color and a master volume control. The Bass Mid and Treble controls are shared between the two channels.

A lot of times you will see guitar players running a short jumper cable between the two channels of the amplifier. Doing this allows you to blend the tone of the two channels with the master volume controls taking full advantage of the amplifier''''s capabilities.

This is accomplished by a very simple process. Plug your guitar on the low-sensitivity input of channel 1. Connect input 2 of channel 1 to input 1 of channel 2 using an instrument patch cable. You can then blend the channels by adjusting the channel volumes of the amplifier. Try it out for yourself to open the tonal capabilities of this amp.

Delivering clear, pristine sound quality at a price point that makes it accessible to the home studio market, the TLM 103 is the flagbearer of a new generation of Neumann microphones that balance unmatched versatility with unbeatable value. At the heart of the Neumann TLM 103 is a purpose-built large-diaphragm condenser capsule derived from the U 87—Neumann''''s iconic studio condenser that has long set the standard for studio performance. Combined with innovative transformerless circuitry and a suite of intelligent design elements, the TLM 103 offers ultra-low self-noise, a wide dynamic range, and a fixed cardioid pattern that renders audio in breathtaking detail. Simply put, it''''s a modern classic and a beautiful expression of the classic Neumann sound.

## An Affordable Alternative to the U 87
Introduced in 1997 with the home and project studio audience in mind, the TLM 103 was quickly adopted by audio professionals the world over for its faithful replication of the timeless U 87 sound. Ditching the bulky transformer in favor of Neumann''''s transformerless microphone technology, the TLM 103 is roughly half the size and a third of the price of the U 87. The TLM 103''''s large-diaphragm K 103 capsule captures the smooth, natural response of the U 87, allowing it to translate the essence of any sound source with stunning accuracy. However, it offers a slightly modern twist with a gentle 4dB presence boost above 5kHz, lending a sense of airiness and dimension that helps vocals and solo instruments pop out of the mix.

## Transformerless Circuitry for Stunning Clarity
While the TLM 103 was built as an accessible riff on the U 87, it manages to improve upon its source material in a few key ways. For one, it utilizes a fixed cardioid capsule and innovative transformerless microphone (TLM) technology to reduce noise in ways that transformer-based multi-pattern condensers simply can''''t compete with. This innovative circuitry ensures an incredibly transparent signal path that stays true to the original source. Even more impressive is the TLM 103''''s ultralow 7dB-A self-noise, allowing it to capture the most delicate whispers and nuanced details without a hint of hiss or coloration. This striking purity of sound makes it ideal for applications where the utmost clarity is required, such as hushed vocal takes, classical recordings and Foley work.

## A Wide Dynamic Range Brings Impressive Versatility
On the other end of the spectrum, Neumann''''s transformerless circuitry also allows the TLM 103 to handle tremendous sound pressure levels up to 138dB without the need for preattenuation. With a vast dynamic range of 131dB, the TLM is a true workhorse in the studio, capable of capturing everything from the delicate details of a fingerpicked acoustic to the high-volume intensity of a maxed-out amplifier. No need to worry about adjusting levels—just let the TLM 103 capture every nuance in vivid detail. Its combination of delicate transparency and robust SPL handling makes it an incredibly versatile studio tool.

## Cardioid Pattern Eliminates Unwanted Sound
The TLM 103 features a tight cardioid polar pattern that rejects ambient noise from the rear and side while minimizing off-axis coloration. The result is focused and precise pickup that that renders the intended sound source in striking clarity and detail. It''''s perfect for isolating vocals and acoustic instruments and allows you to track loud sources like drums and amplifiers without excessive bleed. With its highly directional polar pattern and excellent feedback suppression, the TLM 103 is even a solid choice for live applications and has been used by the likes of Jack White to mic guitar amps on stage.

First released by the fledgling Royer Labs in 1998, the R-121 single-handedly sparked a revolution in ribbon mic technology with its compact, tough-as-nails construction and incredible versatility. Over 25 years later, the Royer R-121 has officially achieved icon status. Its sleek, lightweight design—revolutionary in the late ’90s —has become the industry standard, and recording professionals around the world swear by it as their go-to mic for everything from huge electric guitar tones to smooth and natural-sounding strings and horns.


Balancing classic ribbon warmth and openness with high-quality modern components and innovative engineering, the R-121 helped redefine when, how and where a ribbon mic could be used. Boasting higher output and massive SPL handling, the R-121 is capable of capturing a wide variety of sound sources with its ultra-smooth and well-balanced response. If you’re looking for a reliable ribbon mic that’s flexible enough to meet the demands of the modern studio, the Royer R-121 is it.

## Timeless Ribbon Tone for the Modern Era
When Royer Labs founder David Royer went all-in on ribbon mics in the 1990s, it was anything but a safe bet. For many studio professionals, the ribbon mic was simply too cumbersome, too fragile and too niche to make it a viable option. The R-121 changed all of this. Each ultra-low-mass 2.5-micron aluminum ribbon is hand-rolled through a hyper-precise corrugator for increased durability and flexibility, giving the R-121 an enormous SPL rating of 135dB. With the addition of powerful neodymium magnets and a compact, state-of-the-art transformer, the R-121 delivers high-output performance with sensitivity similar to that of a good dynamic mic. The result is a microphone that offers an incredibly nuanced, true-to-life sound across a wide variety of applications—from quiet acoustics to gained-out guitar cabinets.

## Offset Ribbon Design for Massive SPL Handling
The R-121''''s proprietary offset ribbon transducer is the first of its kind, positioning the ribbon element closer to the front side of the microphone. This arrangement gives the ribbon more room to flex rearward while remaining in the prime magnetic field when faced with extreme sound pressure levels. As a result, the R-121 is able to maintain full frequency response even in high-SPL situations. It''''s an integral piece of the magic of all Royer R-series microphones—and critical to the R-121''''s reputation for capturing outstanding electric guitars and brass. With the R-121, there’s no need to be shy—use it to close-mic speaker cabinets and capture full-force trumpet blasts with phenomenal results.

## A Classic Mic for Guitar Cabinets—And So Much More
With its lush, incredibly natural sound, high SPL handling and close-miking capabilities, the R-121 has rightfully earned a reputation as one of the best electric guitar mics in the business. Its rich bottom end brings a larger-than-life feel when stacking rhythm tracks, while its smooth and detailed upper midrange make guitar solos soar above the mix. However, the R-121''''s flat and well-balanced response really make it ideal for any application. This workhorse of a ribbon mic captures the low-end punch of the kick drum, the sweet upper-register resonance of the flute and the detailed yet smooth shimmer of cymbals with the same capable authority. And it does it all while delivering that extra-special “it” factor—translating your performances with a lifelike, panoramic feel.

## Two Mics in One
Thanks to the Royer R-121''''s unique offset ribbon technology and bidirectional figure-8 polar pattern, you can actually flip the mic around to unlock a whole new sonic profile. At distances of 30 inches or closer, the R-121 exhibits a slightly brighter response from the back, making it perfect for more delicate sources like vocals, acoustic guitars and strings. Love that warm ribbon mic sound but looking for something with a bit more high-end sparkle? Try focusing the rear lobe of the R-121 on your instrument for a rich and articulate tone. Just make sure to flip the polarity on your preamp or in your DAW when using the back side.

Neumann''''s reputation for audio quality was built on their iconic microphones, and has long been second to none. The Neumann KH 120 II powered nearfield studio monitors, descended from the legendary line of K&H monitors, are the second-generation evolution of the award-winning KH 120. These advanced nearfields utilize leading-edge technology and materials science to deliver stunning sound quality in a compact package.


## Audio Perfection Driven by Science
How does Neumann get such accuracy?  It''''s science, pure and simple. From the physics of the MMD (Mathematically Modeled Dispersion) waveguide, which minimizes desk reflections while delivering an exceptionally wide sweet spot, to the superior resonance control and rigidity of the molded polycarbonate front and rear panels, the KH 120 II utilizes solid science and modern materials to create a reference monitor that provides incredible accuracy from high-precision drivers.


## Loud When You Want, Energy Efficient When You Need
The Neumann KH 120 II features a patent-pending amplifier design engineered to combine outstanding audio performance with energy efficiency. With 145W to the 5" low-frequency driver and 100W to the 1" high-frequency driver, it''''s child''''s play for them to put out more than ample levels for any nearfield application, while only consuming 17W when idling. The auto-standby mode drops power consumption to less than a third of a watt when the monitors have been unused for a period of time, enabling instant access while saving power.


## Advanced DSP for Optimal Accuracy
DSP control has become a major feature in many advanced reference monitors, and the DSP integration in the KH 120 II is superb. The rear panel features basic adjustments for bass, low-mid and high frequency for basic room tuning, plus the ability to switch to network control from the optional MA 1 Automatic Monitor Alignment software. From the MA 1 software, the level of possible adjustments is greatly expanded to allow much more detailed room tuning for your specific acoustic environment, as well as customizing standby mode and other features.


## Your Choice of Analog or Digital Source
Another advantage of the KH 120 II is its ability to accept both analog and S/PDIF digital inputs, enabling the user to keep everything from input to output completely in the digital domain while maintaining compatibility with analog systems. No matter what signal source you use, the Neumann KH 120 II compact nearfield monitors are ready to help you get the best possible mixes.

The PRS Silver Sky is the result of a close collaboration between Grammy Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith. More than two and half years in the making, the Silver Sky is a vintage-inspired instrument that is at once familiar, but also newly PRS through and through. This model was based off of Mayer and Smith''''s favorite elements from 1963 and 1964 vintage instruments, resulting in an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar. The attention that was paid to every detail sets this guitar apart


## Vintage inspired, yet thoroughly PRS
Some of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, tuners, neck and fretboard, bridge, and pickups and electronics. The headstock shape is based on PRS''''s trademark design, but inverted to both accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS''''s locking design. 
 
## The right feel...the right sound
The neck shape was modeled after 1963/1964 vintage instruments, and the fretboard has a 7.25” radius. The moment your hand grabs this neck, it just feels right. Like the tuners, the steel tremolo takes a classic design and incorporates PRS''''s trem arm and Gen III knife-edge screws. The bridge on the Silver Sky is setup flush to the body in the neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch. By keeping the bridge in contact with the body, the guitar itself is acoustically louder, which improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

Other high-quality specifications include a bone nut, a molded metal jack plate that is curved and makes plugging and unplugging a guitar cable hassle-free, retooled knobs, fretwire that is slightly smaller than what you''''d find on most PRS electric guitars, and PRS''''s double action truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). Includes gig bag.
